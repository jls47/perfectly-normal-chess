CHESS WITH WACKY ITEMS

Every piece will be a component with the following:

Itemboxes will be their own piece-like component containing just a string with their name

PROGRAM FLOW


IN GAME:
DEFAULT CHESS BEHAVIOR to be extended:
user clicks space
-is piece?
-If piece in board, run piece.getValidMoves() to highlight moves
-each valid space is highlighted in uhhh light green?
-spaces w opposite pieces highlighted in red
-spaces w same color pieces not highlighted
-if space in green or red, then is valid move
-Otherwise, maintain state of "moving"

*Pieces will handle their own movement logic.  They will somehow turn on the highlighting of the appropriate board spaces?  
*just move to a board space that gets highlighted.  No further logic beyond attacks
*
*Board array will be stored in state.  Updates will be fired back to the server.
